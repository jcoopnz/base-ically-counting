# Base-ically-counting

This is actually a quick remake of Base-ically-counting. Angular has come a long way since version 15 (_at the time of committing v19!_). Soooo.. here you go! 😁

---

A very simple web-app to explore counting in different bases (or number systems).

This very simple web-app consists of inputs for each of the major number systems / bases. Using the correct digits that correspond to the chosen base, you can enter a number and see it's representation in the other bases live (_ie: without having to submit a form..._).

Story goes, I was working with colours in CSS and a question came up in my team around how many colour values there are between RGB vs. HEX. I wanted to demonstrate that there are the same but couldn't find an app online that would allow me to count in different bases without having to submit a form. So, I created base-ically-counting. It's also allowed me to practice creating and deploying apps 😊
